        <p class="verbage">Strings are awesome because they can store large amounts of text without the explicit use of an array. They are a very versatile data type, and can complete some very complex assignments as you get better at programming.</p>
        <div class="code">
          var stringPractice = "This is a string";
          var singleQuots = 'This is also a string';
        </div>
        <p>
          As you can see, you can declare strings with either double or single quotes. If you happen to be writing a string and you want a quote as a character you can use a backslash to "escape" the character and have the compiler ignore it.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          var quoteInString = "This string has a \" in it";
        </div>
